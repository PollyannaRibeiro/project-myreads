# MyReads Project

It's a project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course.
It's bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have already read, are currently reading, or want to read. 

The project emphasizes using React to build the application and the Udacity provides an API server and client library that was used to persist information as we interact with the application.

# Challenges on this project

I'm learning about the functionalities of React. For instance, how to set states, the lifecycle events, render UI with external data. Managing screens using Router, Browser Router and Link Component.

A particular detail that I did, was to avoid unnecessarily requests to the API, I chose to trigger the search request only after waiting for a half second without no keystroke pressed.
